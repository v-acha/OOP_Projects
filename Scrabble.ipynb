    "### Scrabble Game\n",
    "Write a Python program that takes a Scrabble rack as a function argument and prints all \"valid Scrabble English\" words that can be constructed from that rack, along with their Scrabble scores, sorted by score. \"valid Scrabble English\" words are provided in the data source below. A Scrabble rack is made up of 2 to 7 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow anywhere from 2-7 character tiles (letters A-Z, upper or lower case) to be inputted. \n",
    "- Do not restrict the number of same tiles (e.g., a user is allowed to input ZZZZZQQ).\n",
    "  - You need to handle input errors from the user and suggest what that error might be caused by and how to fix it (i.e., a helpful error message). **Return** this error message as a string from the run_scrabble function (do not raise an exception).\n",
    "- Implement wildcards as either `*` or `?`. There can be a total of **only** two wild cards in any user input (that is, one of each character: one `*` and one `?`). Only use the `*` and `?` as wildcard characters. A wildcard character can take any value A-Z. Replace the wildcard symbol with the letter in your answer (see the second example below). \n",
    "  - Wildcard characters are scored as 0 points, just like in the real Scrabble game. A word that just consists of two wildcards can be made, should be outputted and scored as 0 points. \n",
    "  - In a wildcard case where the same word can be made with or without the wildcard, display the highest score. For example: given the input 'I?F', the word 'if' can be made with the wildcard '?F' as well as the letters 'IF'. Since using the letters 'IF' scores higher, display that score.\n",
    "- For partial credit, your program should take less than one minute to run with 2 wildcards in the input. For full credit, the program needs to run with 2 wildcards in less than 30 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Data\n",
    "The file: http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/advjava/lab1/sowpods.zip contains all \"valid Scrabble English\" words in the official words list, one word per line. You should download the word file and keep it in your repository so that the program is standalone (instead of accessing it over the web from Python)."
