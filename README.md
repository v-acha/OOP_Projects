Welcome to my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project repository! In this repository, you will find two projects: a Scrabble game and a bidding auction game. I have built these projects using classes and functions as a part of my journey to learn and understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and standards. This repository is a reflection of my progress and experimentation as I continue to explore the world of OOP. You are welcome to join me in this journey of learning by doing.

1. [Scrabble Game](https://github.com/v-acha/OOP_Projects/blob/main/Scrabble.ipynb)
   - **Description:** This Python script comprises functions for scoring Scrabble words, loading valid words from a file, and generating valid Scrabble words from a given rack, along with their scores. It handles wildcard characters and performs error validation, making it a handy tool for Scrabble enthusiasts looking to optimize their gameplay.
2. [Bidding Algorithm](https://github.com/v-acha/OOP_Projects/blob/main/Bidding_Algorithm.ipynb)
   - **Description:** This code simulates an online ad auction with users and bidders. Users have a hidden probability of clicking ads, while bidders adjust their bids dynamically. The Auction class manages rounds, determining winners, updating balances, and disqualifying low-balance bidders. The plotting function visualizes bidder balance history. Overall, it replicates an auction scenario where bidders vie for ad placement, refining strategies based on past results.
